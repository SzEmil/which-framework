Comparing Next.js, Astro, and SolidStart

This repository contains three folders: nextjs, astro, and solidstart. Each folder contains the same project built with a different front-end framework: Next.js, Astro, and SolidStart. The goal of the project is to compare the performance and functionality of these frameworks by analyzing bundle size, render time, performance tests, and other factors.
Repository Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

    nextjs: Contains the project built with Next.js.
    astro: Contains the project built with Astro.
    solidstart: Contains the project built with SolidStart.

Project Goal

The goal of the project is to determine which front-end framework (Next.js, Astro, SolidStart) is best suited for a particular project. This will be done by comparing the following factors:

    Bundle size: Bundle size is the total size of the compiled JavaScript code that must be delivered to the user's browser. A smaller bundle size can lead to faster page loading.
    Render time: Render time is the time it takes for the user's browser to generate the HTML page. A shorter render time can lead to a smoother user experience.
    Performance: Performance will be measured using various tests, such as JavaScript tests and network performance tests.
    Functionality: All three frameworks offer different features. It is important to assess which features are essential for the project and how each framework supports them.
    Ease of use: Ease of use is an assessment of how easy it is to get started with a framework and how easy it is to build complex web applications.

Usage Instructions

To run each project, navigate to the appropriate folder and run the commands npm install and then npm run dev. This will install the dependencies and start a local server. You can then open the web page in your browser and start testing the project.
Analysis and Conclusions

After testing all three projects, the results should be collected and conclusions drawn. The results should be compared in terms of bundle size, render time, performance, functionality, and ease of use. Any other factors that may impact the choice of framework, such as project budget and timeline, should also be considered.
